# ⛅ Weather App

The **Weather App** is a simple and responsive web application that allows users to search for the current weather in any city using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

> 🛠️ This was one of my beginner projects as I was learning how to work with APIs and build interactive UIs with JavaScript.
